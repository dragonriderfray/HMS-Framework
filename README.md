**Purpose: The purpose of this code is to simulate a Hospital Management System (HMS) that streamlines key administrative and clinical tasks in a healthcare environment. In modern healthcare environments where efficiency and accuracy are critical, this program helps manage essential operations such as patient registration, doctor scheduling, appointment booking, and billing. By automating these processes, the system reduces the need for manual record-keeping, minimizes errors, and enhances the overall quality and speed of patient care.**

**How to run: First ensure Python is installed on the device. Then, transfer the .py file using a USB drive, email, or cloud service. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder containing the file using the cd command, and run it using python filename.py (or python3 filename.py on some systems). Alternatively, the code can be opened and executed in a Python-friendly IDE like VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE.**

**Required Modifications: This program may need additional validation inputs, changes to the time format, it could also use a txt, .csv, .json, or even a database file to store data entered by the user. A GUI would be great as well for user-friendly purposes.**

**This program is a basic hospital management system with several limitations. It lacks a graphical user interface (GUI) and does not use a database to store information all data is held in memory during runtime and lost when the program closes. Additionally, it cannot distinguish between patients with identical names, ages, and genders, and it offers minimal security or access control features.**
